It is marked by <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>decentralized control</strong></u></span>. (Decentralized-the activities of an organization, are distributed or pass on, away from a central authority, location or group.) Cryptocurrencies use <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>extremely complex code</strong></u></span> systems that encrypt sensitive data transfers, to secure their units of exchange. These protocols are built by the developers on advanced mathematics &amp; Computer Engineering principle which are virtually impossible to break &amp; thus it&rsquo;s difficult to imitate the protected currencies. Like real money it typically <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>doesn&rsquo;t exist</strong></u></span> in <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>physical form</strong></u></span> &amp; is also not issued by a central authority. Each Cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>block chain</strong></u></span> that serves as a public financial transaction data base.<br />\r\nAs a consequence, what makes Cryptocurrency so special?<br />\r\nWell, firstly to answer that, it takes little to no transaction cost. While we are using digital wallet, we lose some amount of money. Also, with the use of Cryptocurrencies we have 24/7 access to our money. Cryptocurrencies can be <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>used by anyone</strong></u></span> as there is no need of paper work or documentation, like one need while opening an account in bank, this can be avoided with Cryptocurrencies.<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>Bitcoin</strong></u></span>, First released as open-source software in <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>2009</strong></u></span>, is the <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>first decentralize</strong></u></span> Cryptocurrency. Since the release of Bitcoin, other Cryptocurrencies have been created.</p>', '2021-06-11 12:58:54'),

Of course, it found in the <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>layers of earth</strong></u></span> &amp; is processed by mining. And if we see <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>rupees, dollars, euros, etc</strong></u></span>., we <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>mint</strong></u></span> them.<br />\r\n<strong>For example, Reserve Bank of India, they issue notes and coins, thus it is called minting &amp; the bank is called as mint</strong>. That&rsquo;s how when a <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>bitcoin</strong></u></span> is made, it called <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>minting</strong></u></span>. The process of making new <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>bitcoin</strong></u></span> is called as <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>mining</strong></u></span>. As cryptocurrencies are made from <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>complex algorithms</strong></u></span>, so its not as easy as printing as notes by printing machines. When mining takes place, there are three things going on, firstly the <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><strong><u>miner</u></strong></span>, who is running the <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>mining software</strong></u></span> on computer, <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>time</strong></u></span> to do mining, of course; for that miner its kind of lottery system. In the whole world at a time 20,000 to 25,000 people are mining at the same time &amp; at a time only one individual is able to mine, so that&rsquo;s why I am calling it as a lottery process. Second thing is that in every <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>10 minutes</strong></u></span>, a block gets mine and a miner gets successful in mining. So, whenever, a block gets mine new <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>bitcoin is generated</strong></u></span>.<br />\r\nFor this effort,<span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong> successful miner obtains new cryptocurrency as a reward</strong></u></span>.<br />\r\nThe crypto miner competes with each other to solve complicated mathematical problem using high performance computers. Each problems uses <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>cryptographic hash</strong></u></span> functions that are associated with a <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>block containing</strong></u></span> a cryptocurrency transactions data.<br />\r\nThe first miner to crack each code is rewarded by being able to <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>authorize the transaction</strong></u></span>, &amp; in return for the service provided, cryptocurrencies earn small amount of cryptocurrency of their own. Once the crypto <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>miner successfully completes</strong></u></span> the mathematical problem &amp; <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>verifies the transaction information</strong></u></span>, they add the data to the <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>public block chain ledger</strong></u></span>.</p>', '2021-06-11 12:58:57'),

There is an interesting property about blockchain that once some data has been recorded in blockchain, it becomes very difficult to change it. The blockchain itself, is a<span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><strong> <u>series of block</u></strong></span> that are listed in <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>chronological order</strong></u></span>. Because previously published blocks<span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><strong> </strong><u><strong>cannot be modified or altered</strong></u></span> after they have been <span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>added to the blockchain</strong></u></span>, this provides a level of transparency. After all everyone can see the transactions. A cryptocurrency transaction technically is not finalized until it&rsquo;s added to the blockchain. The blockchain thus prevents double spending, or the exploitation of cryptocurrency code to allow the same currency units to be duplicated &amp; sent to multiple receipts. Also, blockchain is very<strong> </strong><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>difficult to hack</strong></u></span> as hackers need to hack a thousand or more computer at a time.

The Macintosh&#39;s sleek graphical user interface (GUI) was far</span><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong> easier</strong></u></span><span style=\"color:#212121\"> to use than MS-DOS and </span><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>threatened </strong></u></span><span style=\"color:#212121\">to make the Microsoft program obsolete. In response to this threat, Gates announced that Microsoft was developing its own GUI-based operating system called </span><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>Windows</strong></u></span><span style=\"color:#212121\">. Gates then took Microsoft public in 1986 to generate capital. The IPO was a roaring success, raising $61 million and making Gates one of the</span><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong> wealthiest</strong></u></span><span style=\"color:#212121\"> people in the country</span><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong> overnight</strong></u></span><span style=\"color:#212121\">.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#212121\">When Windows was finally released in 1985, it wasn&#39;t exactly the breakthrough Gates had predicted. </span><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>Critics</strong></u></span><span style=\"color:#212121\"> claimed it was slow and cumbersome. Apple wasn&#39;t exactly pleased either. They saw Windows as a rip-off of the Macintosh operating system and </span><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>sued</strong></u></span><span style=\"color:#212121\">. The case would drag on until the mid-1990s, when the courts finally decided that Apple&#39;s suit had </span><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>no merit</strong></u></span><span style=\"color:#212121\">.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#212121\">Meanwhile, Gates worked on </span><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>improving </strong></u></span><span style=\"color:#212121\">Windows.

Third-party programmers began </span><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong>developing</strong></u></span><span style=\"color:#212121\"> Windows-based programs, and Microsoft&#39;s own applications became hot sellers.

The</span><span style=\"color:#ff6842\"><u><strong> strategy</strong></u></span><span style=\"color:#212121\"> worked so well that by 1999 Microsoft was posting sales of $19.7 billion, and Gates&#39; personal wealth had grown to a phenomenal $90 billion.</span></span></span></span></span></p>', '2021-08-17 08:42:55'),
